# hello-world
This is the start of something wonderful...
I am 33 years old and looking for a way out of the industrial workforce. I have 12 years experience writing programs for CNC mills and Lathes. I have learned a bit of HTML over the years, and am excited to get started making my way through the many trials ahead.
